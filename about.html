    <h2>Hello, I'm Gabriel</h2>
    <p>I am a graduating graphic designer receiving my BFA at California State University, East Bay. I was born and raised in the Bay Area. I have experience in design and layout for use in print collateral & digital platforms. Having worked at CSU East Bay as a graphic design intern, I’ve managed to view and complete assigned tasks such as flyers and posters that the senior graphic designer would have. </p>
    <p>My creativity and strong desire to meet client’s expectations is of the utmost importance. The software I have experience in is Adobe Suite: Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. In addition, I also have knowledge of Web Design skills that consists of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and web server management. Outside of being a graphic designer, I enjoy working out, playing videogames, and going on walks.</p>
